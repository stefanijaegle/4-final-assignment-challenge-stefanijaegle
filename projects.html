                    <h2>About the project:</h2> 
                    <p>For this  we worked in pairs. Our client was web shop (real web shop name and logo has been removed/replaced because of legal reasons). Web-shop is importer of mainly Dutch food, but also some souvenirs, Dutch goods in The USA. Starting the project we were provided just with a web site we needed to re-design (not all, just home page, product overview, product detail page and check out process) and persona- in order to know for whom we are designing.
                    Below you can find the current version of web shop, which we needed to re-design.</p>
